# Analysis of the Vulnerability
# PHP Code Overview
```
php
Copy code
<?php

if (!isset($_GET['start'])){
    show_source(__FILE__);
    exit;
} 

include ($_POST['start']);
echo $secret;
```

# this PHP script exhibits a classic case of LFI due to the following:

Conditional Source Disclosure: The show_source(__FILE__); function call, triggered when the start GET parameter is not set, reveals the source code of the current file. This assists an attacker in understanding the server-side logic.

Unsanitized Inclusion: The include ($_POST['start']); statement is critical. The include directive in PHP allows a file to be included and executed in the script. Here, the file path is taken directly from the start POST parameter without any form of sanitization or validation, leading to LFI.

Local File Inclusion (LFI)
LFI occurs when a script includes local files (like flag.php in this case) based on user input. This can lead to unauthorized disclosure of files, remote code execution, or other security breaches. It's a severe issue, especially when system files or sensitive information can be accessed.

# Exploitation of the Vulnerability
```
CURL Request
bash
Copy code
curl 'http://35.198.135.192:30265?start=1' -XPOST --data 'start=flag.php'
```

# The exploitation is carried out using the above CURL request:

# Bypassing Conditional Check: 
The GET parameter start=1 ensures that the script doesn't exit at the initial conditional check and doesn't reveal the source code.

# Exploiting the Inclusion: 
The -XPOST --data 'start=flag.php' part of the command exploits the LFI vulnerability. It passes flag.php as the value for the start POST parameter, causing the script to include flag.php.

# Outcome
As a result of this exploitation, the contents of flag.php are included and executed. This presumably outputs the contents of the $secret variable, revealing the flag.

# Conclusion
This challenge is a prime example of the importance of proper input validation and sanitization in web applications. The absence of these security measures leads to vulnerabilities like LFI, which can be exploited to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the system. Such challenges not only test technical skills but also emphasize the necessity of writing secure code in real-world applications.
